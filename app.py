**Important Notes on Free Usage:**
* This tool uses **free public APIs** (Nominatim for geocoding, OSRM for routing). These APIs have **rate limits**. If you submit too many addresses or run the solver too often,
    you might experience delays or temporary errors.
* For best results, use **less than 50-70 addresses** at a time, especially with the OSRM public server. For **very large problems or consistent high usage**, consider self-hosting Nominatim/OSRM or using paid services.
